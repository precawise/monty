0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
In the context of the C programming language, the "0x19. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO" refers to a project or module that focuses on the implementation of stacks and queues using the concepts of Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO).

Stacks: A stack is a linear data structure where elements are added or removed from only one end known as the top of the stack. The elements follow the LIFO principle, meaning that the last element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a stack of plates where you can only access the top plate.

Queues: A queue is also a linear data structure, but elements are added to one end called the rear and removed from the other end known as the front. The elements follow the FIFO principle, meaning that the first element added is the first one to be removed. Think of it as a queue of people waiting in line, where the first person to arrive is the first one to be served.

The purpose of this project or module is to provide an understanding of how stacks and queues work, their implementation using linked lists or arrays, and the associated operations such as push (addition), pop (removal), peek (accessing the top/front element), and more.

By studying and implementing these data structures and their corresponding algorithms, programmers can efficiently solve problems that require LIFO or FIFO behavior, such as evaluating mathematical expressions, handling function calls, managing tasks, and processing data in various applications.
